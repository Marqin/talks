# Git and Gitlab

Hubert Jarosz, 2016

---

# Installation

#### Linux

Should be already installed. If not - install **`git`** package using your
package manager.

#### macOS

It will be installed along with other Command Line Tools via:  
```
xcode-select --install
```  
If you want newer version - get it via
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
```
brew install git
```

#### Windows

Download from https://git-scm.com/download/  

All examples will use git shell, not GUI nor third-party software.

---

# Git

* snapshots of filesystem, not diffs

* most things are local

* integrity - SHA-1 checksums

### Glossary

**Commit** object - pointer to a snapshot, identified by SHA-1 hash

**Tag** - named pointer to commit object (eg. `v0.1`)

**Branch** - movable named pointer to commit object

Branch moves forward automatically with each time you commit on it.
Default branch in Git is named `master`.

---

# Introduction

## Create new repository

```
mkdir repo_name
cd repo_name
git init
```

## Clone existing repository

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce
cd gitlab-ce
```
or
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce my_gitlab-ce
cd my_gitlab-ce
```

---

# Staging code

If we want to add new files or our changes to commit we have to **stage**
those files.

For one file:
```
git add path/to/file
```

Mass-stage all files in repo:
```
git add .
```

### protip

```
git status
```

---

# Commiting your code

Simple way:
```
git commit -m "Some commit message."
```

If you want multi-line commit message:
```
git commit
```

**BEWARE** - latter command may run **vi** as your default editor. To forcefully quit vi
press `Esc`, write `:q!`, and press `ENTER`.

### protip

```
git commit -a -m "Some commit message."
```
`-a` flag stages all changed files (but doesn't add new ones to repo!)

---

# Pulling and pushing

#### Pull new commits from remote repository
```
git pull
```

**BEWARE** - if you have made new commit in local repo and there are new commits
in remote, you may need to merge. If Git does auto-merge and prompts **vi**, you
have to press **Esc**, write **:wq** and press **ENTER** to confirm.

In some cases you may have merge conflicts. In such case read about resolving
them in Git documentation.

#### Push commits to remote repository
```
git push
```

#### View log of commits on current branch
```
git log
```

---

# Branches

Create new branch named *`fix_asset_42`*:
```
git checkout -b fix_asset_42
```

Get back to master:
```
git checkout master
```

See on which branch you are:
```
git branch
```

Print all local branches:
```
git branch --list
```

Print all local and remote branches:
```
git branch --all
```

---

# GitLab

* Git repository manager

* issue tracking, code reviews and wikis

* free private repositories

* can be self-hosted (it's open source!)

# Workflow

1. Fork the project to your own repository.

2. Work different features on different branches.

3. Make *Merge Request* of your branches to main project.
